## Overview 

### Introduction ðŸ‘‹

This is meant to be a fullstack MERN project which shows a list of companies that are hiring without a whiteboard process. Data was provided by (Jon)[https://twitter.com/NoWhiteboardOrg]. At first I used react-bootstrap for the frontend but have now switched to NextUI. :)
